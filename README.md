## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Lizzy, I write code and sometimes it works. My pronouns are she/her. My website can be found at https://lizainslie.dev.

A fun fact about me is that I got to meet the Missouri governor at a cybersecurity competition (ironic, yes) in 2019. Now he's out making Tweets that make me regret ever going there :D

Right now I'm not looking to collaborate on anything or do anything with anyone as I have my schedule pretty full with my company work and freelance contract work. Sorry if you wanted to work with me and are disappointed; I'm still accepting ideas/offers though and would be glad to add yours to a backlog of sorts!

I listen to a lot of music (I mean a LOT). I have music on almost 100% of my waking day. Feel free to ask me what kinds of music I'm interested in! Meanwhile here's my playlist on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/45x8Pw3oLXM6HplaG2u06p
