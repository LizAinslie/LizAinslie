## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Lizzy, an independent full stack engineer from Tucson, AZ. My pronouns are she/her.

A fun fact about me is that I got to meet the Missouri governor at a cybersecurity competition (ironic, yes) in 2019. Now he's out making Tweets that make me regret ever going there. I'm also 99% self-taught!

Want to find friends to collab with on code, hit me up if you're interested in what I'm building or are building something you think I'd be interested in!

I listen to a lot of music (I mean a LOT). I have music on almost 100% of my waking day. Feel free to ask me what kinds of music I'm interested in! Meanwhile here's my playlist on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/45x8Pw3oLXM6HplaG2u06p

### How to reach me
If you need help, have an idea or just want to chat you can reach me on Discord `@lizzythewitch` or by joining the [Crack CafÃ©](https://discord.gg/hKd9eQTQmZ). For business inquiries, email me at (lizzy at lizainslie dot dev). You can also find me [on Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/0xLizzyTheWitch)

### My skillset
I'm familiar with quite a few languages, so let me list them here.

- Java
- Kotlin (I utilize Kotlin on the JVM and through Kotlin/Native)
- Golang
- C/C++
- Assembly
- Python
- JavaScript & TypeScript
- HTML/CSS and relevant preprocessors
- Dart
- Lua
- Rust

I have a particular set of skills:

- Web development using:
  - Next, React, Vue, Astro (frontend/fullstack)
  - Ktor, Rails, Django (backend)
- Minecraft development For Spigot/Fabric using Kotlin I will not touch Java
- Mobile & desktop development with Jetpack Compose, Flutter, Expo, Electron and GTK
- Payment processing with Braintree, Paypal, Stripe
- Bot development using Kord or Discord.js. Learning Serenity.
- Game Development using:
  - LibGDX, KorGE/Korlibs, LWJGL
  - THREE.js & Phaser. Loving react-three-fiber

Stuff I'd like to learn:
- Elixir. I know it's not all that useful to what I do but it's a language I treasure
- Game development in general. I'd like to broaden my horizons and enable myself to express my own creativity in new ways, and game dev is one of these ways.
- VST programming, I'm an audio junkie.
- EFI programming, because I really enjoy low level systems dev. I already have plans to work on this at some point in the future

### My Work
Here's what I'm currently working on:

- Decentralized software alternatives @illumi-engineering
- Day job writing medical compliance software (the only time you'll find me writing c#)
- Private client work. Always got something in that front lol.

Here are some projects I am the most proud of:
- [HUI-Builder](https://github.com/Studio-Archetype/HUI-Builder) - A menu editor for a paid Spigot resource that I implemented the bulk of in just a few days. I'm most proud of the canvas editing and image manipulation, it turned out much better than I expected.
