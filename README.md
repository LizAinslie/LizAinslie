## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Lizzy, I write code and sometimes (most of the time ðŸ˜…) it works. My pronouns are she/her. My website can be found at https://lizainslie.dev.

A fun fact about me is that I got to meet the Missouri governor at a cybersecurity competition (ironic, yes) in 2019. Now he's out making Tweets that make me regret ever going there. I'm also 99% self-taught!

~~Right now I'm not looking to collaborate on anything or do anything with anyone as I have my schedule pretty full with my company work and freelance contract work. Sorry if you wanted to work with me and are disappointed; I'm still accepting ideas/offers though and would be glad to add yours to a backlog of sorts!~~ The previous sentences are only half true; work has let up a little bit, so if you have any ideas you'd like to see me make, please reach out because I'd love to hear them. Maybe I/we can make one!

I listen to a lot of music (I mean a LOT). I have music on almost 100% of my waking day. Feel free to ask me what kinds of music I'm interested in! Meanwhile here's my playlist on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/45x8Pw3oLXM6HplaG2u06p

**Stuff I'm currently learning:**

- Nothing really, just grinding thru my work.

**Stuff I'd like to learn:**
- Rust. As many times as I have tried it, and even with all my experience in C and C++, I just can't seem to grasp Rust.
- Elixir. I know it's not all that useful to what I do but it's a language I treasure
- Game development in general. I'd like to broaden my horizons and enable myself to express my own creativity in new ways, and game dev is one of these ways.
- VST programming, I'm an audio junkie.
- EFI programming, because I really enjoy low level systems dev. I already have plans to work on this at some point in the near future

### My projects
Here's what I'm currently working on:

- [Synapse Technologies](https://synapsetech.dev/) - I am the CEO of Synapse Technologies, LLC & Synapse Media Ltd. Right now we are working to push our flagship product, Reflex to production.
- [Firefight](https://firefig.ht/) - A competitive shooter in Minecraft that I am developing for!
- [Kineticraft](https://kineticraft.net) - A semi-vanilla SMP server that I am volunteering to help maintain custom code for.
- Private client work. Always got something in that front lol.

Here are some projects I am the most proud of:

- [MyRPC](https://github.com/MyRPC/MyRPC) - MyRPC is a custom Discord RPC application I built in early 2019. It was pretty popular before it up and died.
- [AlpineOS](https://github.com/AlpineOS/AlpineOS) - An OS I've been building with a few friends. We're struggling to find a good name for it, and I might just name it AsbestOS for the meme.
- [HUI-Builder](https://github.com/Studio-Archetype/HUU-Builder) - A menu editor for a paid Spigot resource that I implemented the bulk of in just a few days. I'm most proud of the canvas editing and image manipulation, it turned out much better than I expected.
